Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 6, 2025, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.  First Quarter 2025 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $151.0 billion and $155.5 billion, or to grow between 5% and 9% compared with first quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unusually large, unfavorable impact of approximately $2.1 billion, or 150 basis points, from foreign exchange rates. Also, as a reminder, in first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year added approximately $1.5 billion in net sales. • Operating income is expected to be between $14.0 billion and $18.0 billion, compared with $15.3 billion in first quarter 2024.   • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud.

 Document Exhibit 99.2 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these"

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. For a quantitative reconciliation of our free cash flow measures to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics” in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar in “Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics” in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

It’s very early days in all of our businesses and we remain excited by how much more we can make customers’ lives better and easier moving forward.” Highlights Obsessing over the customer experience Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon: • Continued to delight customers with fast and convenient delivery."

For example, Amazon: • Continued to delight customers with fast and convenient delivery. With more than 2 billion global units arriving the same or next day in Q1, Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. • Expanded selection across the company’s stores with the launch of popular brands. In the U.S., this included Gen Z favorite Parade; luxury fashion and accessories from AREA and HBX Archives by Hypebeast; beauty brands Clinique, Keys Soulcare by Alicia Keys, and LOVED01 by John Legend; tech brands Oura Ring and Sonos speakers; and officially-licensed products from the National Women’s Soccer League. In Europe, Luxury Stores at Amazon announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. • Helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including Amazon’s Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the U.S., where customers saved on a wide selection of items including fashion, outdoor furniture, lawn and garden essentials, and cleaning and organizing products.

Prime Video, which is home to  Thursday Night Football , will have exclusive rights to air an opening round playoff game.  • Earned 12 awards for Amazon MGM Studios film  American Fiction , including nine for Best Adapted Screenplay by writer/director Cord Jefferson. These include an Academy Award, BAFTA Film Award, Critics Choice Award, two Independent Spirit Awards, and two Writers Guild of America Awards.   • Grew Prime Video’s international slate of content with more than 30 local Amazon Originals, including  Operación Triunfo  (Spain), Prime Video’s first weekly live entertainment show, which was watched by more than 3.5 million unique viewers in Spain;  Indian Police Force  (India), which had the most viewers complete the entire first season for any Amazon India Original in i"

 Document Exhibit 99.2 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these"

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. For a quantitative reconciliation of our free cash flow measures to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics” in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. We include various measures on both an as-reported basis and a basis showing the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar in “Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics” in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
